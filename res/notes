- communities are groups of nodes that are
densely interconnected but only sparely connected with the rest
of the network

- In order to extract such groups of nodes, one
typically chooses an objective function that captures the intuition
of a community as a group of nodes with better internal connectiv-
ity than external connectivity. (NP-Hard) -> heuristics

heuristics -> a consequence, the conventional community detection can be
considered as a single-objective optimization problem (SOP). ->
the single-objective community detection also faces some
fundamental difficulties. These single-objective algorithms usually
confine the solution to a particular community structure property
because of only considering one objective function.
In addition, one single fixed com-
munity partition returned by the single-objective algorithms may
not be suitable for the networks with multiple potential structures

how to solve? 

formulate the community detection as a
multi-objective optimization problem (MOP).

propose a novel

multi-objective community detection algorithm (called MOCD).
The MOCD includes two phases. In the first community detection
phase, MOCD simultaneously optimizes two conflicting objective
functions with evolutionary algorithm (EA) and returns a set of
solutions which are optimal in terms of optimization objectives.
